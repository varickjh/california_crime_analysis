# California Crime and Law Enforcement Data Analysis
This project aims to analyze the **law enforcement employment rates, crime rates, and their relation** in the **cities of California** in **2015**. 
In this project I have utilized datasets from Kaggle:
- [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fbi-us/california-crime?select=ca_law_enforcement_by_city.csv)

The original datasets can be found in the [FBI UCR Website](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015).
### Aim & Outcomes
1. Which California agencies, cities, counties have a higher number of reported crimes?
